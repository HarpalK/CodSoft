                <h3 class="product-heading">üåæ Sourcing of A2 Milk</h3>
                <p>Our ghee begins with the A2 milk of native Indian cow breeds, like Gir and Sahiwal, who are raised in organic, stress-free environments and fed on natural grass, herbs, and mineral-rich fodder. Unlike hybrid cows, these cows naturally produce A2 beta-casein protein, which is easier to digest and less inflammatory for the human body. We avoid artificial insemination, antibiotics, growth hormones, or chemical-laden feeds ‚Äî ensuring absolute purity and ethical sourcing.
